## ✨ What it is

Most job tools either autofill the same form a hundred times, or dump a feed of loosely-matched listings on you. Neither tells you which roles are actually worth your time, or who to talk to.

**Who it's for:** engineers at every seniority, from new grad to staff, across software, infrastructure, data, ML, and security. The shared pool is broad and each person's feed is narrowed to their own discipline, level, and location, so one account fits a backend new grad and a senior SRE alike.

Jobrolu runs the search the way it actually works: **aggregate** from clean sources, **rank** every role honestly against a real profile, and **hand you the recruiter** to email with a personalized draft. You always do the final send. No spammy auto-apply, no hallucinated matches.

**You make an account first.** Jobrolu ranks against *you*, so you sign up, build a profile (a quick form, a resume, or your own AI), and a feed of the live job pool ranked for you unlocks. Everyone has an equal account; each person gets their own profile and their own ranked feed.

## 🧠 How it works (the funnel)

The whole design exists to keep cost near zero while still using AI where it matters. Jobs flow through stages, and **only one stage costs money**.

## 🏷️ How ranking works, and what the scores mean

**This is the most important thing to understand, because two different systems produce the numbers you see.**

There are two scorers, and they are NOT on the same scale:

1. **The free heuristic scorer** (`score.py`) reads keywords, the job title, seniority words, and location. It is fast and free, and it runs on *every* job. It is a rough guess. It can give a high number to a job just because the title looks right ("Graduate Software Engineer" scores high on the new-grad and SWE-title signals even if zero of your skills appear in the text).

2. **The AI fit-ranker** (`rank.py`) reads the *full job description* against your profile and produces a careful, considered score with real reasons, gaps, and disqualifiers. Only the top N jobs (default 100) ever reach this step, because it is the only paid step.

### The three tiers

| Tier | Who decided it | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **Strong** | The AI only | The AI read the full posting and confirmed a strong fit. Trustworthy. The heuristic can **never** award Strong. |
| 🟡 **Possible** | AI *or* heuristic | Either the AI judged it a moderate fit, or it only passed the free keyword pre-filter and the AI has not read it yet. |
| ⚪ **Skip** | AI *or* heuristic | Clear non-fit (seniority, clearance, wrong role), or a low heuristic score. |

### Why a "Possible" can show a higher number than a "Strong" (and why that is correct)

You will sometimes see a Possible job at, say, **78** sitting above a Strong job at **72**. That is expected, not a bug:

- The **78** is the *free heuristic's* unverified estimate. The AI never read that job.
- The **72** is the *AI's* verified verdict after reading the full posting.

A verified 72 is worth more than an unverified 78. They measure different things. To make this obvious, the UI marks the difference:

- **AI-verified** scores show in solid color with an **"AI verified"** tag and a `FIT` ring.
- **Estimated** (heuristic, not yet read by the AI) scores show muted, prefixed with a `~`, with an **"Estimate only"** tag and an `EST` ring.

So a green `88` with "AI verified" is a real judgment. A grey `~78` with "Estimate only" is a hunch to be confirmed.

### Turning estimates into verified scores

The free pass ranks the whole pool, but only your top matches are AI-read, and a genuinely good role with a plain or unusual title can sit lower until an AI reads it. Two ways to verify:

- **Bring-your-own-AI, right in the app (free).** On your feed, **Rank my matches** hands you a ready-made prompt covering your top 150 roles, each with its full description, to paste into your own ChatGPT or Claude. Paste the JSON back and those roles become verified fits, stored as yours, for **$0**. (The `export_rank.py` / `import_rank.py` CLI does the same from the command line.)
- **`TOP_N`** for a paid command-line run that reads deeper into the pool (see the cost model below).

---

## 💸 Cost model

Only the AI fit-rank step costs money. Everything else (sourcing, prefilter, heuristic scoring, hydration, the LinkedIn recruiter search) is plain HTTP and free.

| Scan depth | Jobs the AI reads | First run | Re-run (cache) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 (default) | top 100 | ~$1 | ~$0 |
| 300 | top 300 | ~$2-3 | ~$0 |
| 800 (deep sweep) | top 800 | ~$8 | ~$0 |
| Rank my matches | top 150, your own AI | **$0** | $0 |

In the app, the free **Rank my matches** flow (your own AI, top 150) costs **$0** and is the default way to verify. Paid depths above are set with `TOP_N` on the host for deeper command-line sweeps. The **cache** makes repeats free: a job already AI-read is never paid for again, so a re-run only pays for genuinely new jobs. The server hard-caps any single run at 2000 jobs as a backstop, and an Anthropic spend cap is the final ceiling.

The **cache** (`jobcache.py`) is what keeps it cheap: each posting has a stable id, and once the AI ranks it, the result is reused forever. Re-runs only pay for jobs that are genuinely new since last time.

Resume parsing on profile upload is one small LLM call (cents). It reads even scanned/image-only PDFs, and infers your likely target roles and location from your experience, which you review and edit before saving. Outreach drafts for strong matches are cents and are also cached.

---

## 🔐 Accounts and budget protection

Everyone has an equal account; there is no special owner tier. The model is simple:

- **Create an account, then build a profile.** Sign up with an email and password, then build your profile (a quick form, a resume upload, or letting your own AI describe you). The feed is gated: you must be signed in, and you need a profile, so nobody lands on a wall of unranked jobs or sees someone else's scores.
- **Sign in and sign out.** Passwords are hashed (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, stdlib, no extra dependency) with a per-user salt and verified in constant time; the session is a signed, HttpOnly cookie. A profile built before signing up is kept, but a second account created on the same browser gets its own identity, so accounts never overwrite each other and one account never sees another's profile.
- **Your feed is yours.** Once you have a profile, you see the shared job pool ranked for *you* by the free heuristic, plus any roles you have personally verified. New jobs show as estimates until you verify them.
- **Verifying is free for everyone.** **Rank my matches** turns your top 150 roles into verified fits using your own ChatGPT or Claude, at no cost; it sends each role's full description so the AI judges the complete posting. Those verified rankings are stored against your profile and overlay your feed. Resume upload is open to every signed-in account.
- **The job pool refreshes itself.** New roles are pulled and heuristic-ranked automatically on a schedule (free, no AI), so the feed stays current on its own; the app shows a live countdown to the next scan. Any action that spends the deployment's API budget stays behind the access code, and a spend cap in the Anthropic console is the hard ceiling.
- **The shared pool is durable.** Each Refresh writes the resulting pool to Postgres, not just the host's disk, so a redeploy never reverts it. The feed reads the pool from Postgres (falling back to the committed file when the database is empty or off) and caches it in memory, so it is not re-parsed on every request.

Configure on the host (Railway) with env vars:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Required, powers ranking and drafts |
| `ACCESS_CODE` | The code that gates any action which spends the API budget (a paid refresh or single-role scan). Those actions are open to anyone if unset |
| `COOKIE_SECRET` | Fixed random string so sessions and the refresh unlock survive redeploys |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres for accounts, per-user profiles, per-user rankings, and the durable shared job pool (with no database set, the site serves the committed file feed and skips accounts, for local dev) |
| `DB_POOL_MAX` | Optional. Max pooled DB connections (default 10) |
| `SCAN_INTERVAL_HOURS` | Optional. Hours between automatic free job pulls (default 24) |
| `AUTO_SCAN` | Optional. Set to `0` to disable the automatic scheduled pull (default on) |
| `PROFILE_PATH` | Optional. The owner profile file the command-line pipeline reads (default `my_profile.json`) |
| `ENRICH_DESCRIPTIONS` | Optional. Set to `1` to fetch full descriptions for boards that omit them (SmartRecruiters, Workday) before ranking |
| `OWNER_USER_ID` | Optional. A fixed random id that marks the owner across devices |

API keys live only in the host's private environment, never in this repo.

## 📡 Sources and coverage

Live roles are pulled in parallel from **7 ATS platforms** (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Recruitee, Workable, Workday) plus the **Adzuna** keyword aggregator and curated new-grad lists.

The **self-growing registry** (`registry.py`) reads the ATS token out of every job URL it ingests, so the company list compounds automatically. Widen coverage on demand with `seed.py`, `bulk_seed.py`, or `seed_workday.py` (all $0 API, validated against live boards).

A few boards (SmartRecruiters, Workday) leave the description out of their list feed. `enrich_desc.py` can fetch the full posting from their detail pages for the roles about to be ranked, so the AI reads the complete text on those too (enable with `ENRICH_DESCRIPTIONS=1`).

Out of scope by design: LinkedIn and Indeed forbid scraping. The right way to use those is applying directly, by hand.

```

Or run the hosted site (landing, onboarding, live feed):

```bash
uvicorn server:app --port 8000
```

Knobs: `TOP_N=0` for a fully free run, `TOP_N=300` to rank deeper. See `RUNNING.md` for everything.

## 🧭 Roadmap: capture jobs from anywhere

The goal is to let people rank jobs from anywhere they already look, not only the sourced pool, using the same profile-aware brain, one job at a time, paid for by the user's own AI so it stays free to run.

### Phase 0: Add a job by hand (shipped)

A signed-in user can paste any job (description, plus optional title, company, location, and link) on the feed page. It is stored as a per-user *saved job*, scored immediately against their profile by the same heuristic, and merged into their feed. It then rides the existing bring-your-own-AI ranking, so they can verify it in full for free, exactly like a sourced role.

The server foundation here is also what the extension will use: a `saved_jobs` table keyed by `(user_id, job_id)`, `POST /api/saved/add` (dedupes, scores, returns a card), `POST /api/saved/remove`, and the saved jobs merged into both the per-user feed and the AI-rank candidates. Dedup is by a stable id, so re-adding the same posting never duplicates it or wastes a rank, and a saved job stays visible even under a tier filter so it never silently vanishes.

### Phase 1: Browser extension (planned)

The vision: as a user scrolls LinkedIn or Handshake and opens a job, the extension reads that posting, scores it against their Jobrolu profile with their own AI, and adds it to their feed automatically. Every account links its own extension, so each person's browsing fills their own feed. We start with Handshake (friendlier), then LinkedIn.

How it works:
- A content script reads the job the user is viewing: title, company, location, the full description (including the text hidden behind "see more"), the posted date, and the page URL.
- A stable job id comes from the URL (LinkedIn and Handshake both carry a numeric job id), so the same posting always maps to the same id.
- The extension dedupes locally (a set of ids it has already ranked) and the server dedupes too (per-user rankings keyed by id), so a refresh or a revisit never re-ranks or re-charges.
- A new job is ranked once with the user's own AI key (bring-your-own-AI, one posting at a time, a fraction of a cent), then posted to the website, which stores it in the user's feed through the same `saved_jobs` path.
- Account linkage: the website issues a per-user connect token; the user pastes it into the extension once.
- A small popup handles connect-to-account, the AI key, an on/off toggle, and a "ranked today" count.

### Design requirements captured (so none get lost)

- **No wasted credits.** Dedup by stable job id, both locally and on the server. A refresh, a next-job-then-back, and a re-open must never re-rank a job already ranked.
- **Full descriptions.** Read the complete posting from the page, including the text behind the "see more" button, because the full description gives a far better score than a snippet. This is also why the extension beats any server fetch: LinkedIn and Handshake sit behind login and JavaScript, so a server request only hits a wall, while the user's own logged-in page already has the full text.
- **Job dates.** Capture the posted date shown on LinkedIn and Handshake and carry it through, so recency feeds into both the score and the card.
- **Full user context in scoring.** The score already uses target titles, seniority, skills, location preferences, work experience, and projects; the extension keeps all of that and adds the full job text. (Education and links are stored and can be added to the AI prompt later.)
- **Free to run.** Bring-your-own-AI: the user's key does the work. There is no truly free production AI API, but one posting is a tiny prompt, so it is effectively free for the user and costs nothing to run.

### Honest risks and how we handle them

- **LinkedIn terms of service.** Automated reading of LinkedIn pages is against their user agreement. Reading the page a user is already viewing, with no auto-clicking and no auto-applying, is lower risk than server scraping and is what comparable extensions do, but it is not zero risk, and the user carries some account risk. We stay read-only, move at the user's own pace, and start with Handshake.
- **Page structure changes.** LinkedIn and Handshake change their HTML often, so the selectors will break and need upkeep. This is ongoing maintenance, not a one-time build.
- **Store review.** A LinkedIn-reading extension can draw extra scrutiny in the Chrome Web Store.
- **Not open source.** The capture and ranking logic stays proprietary to protect the product, so it is not published for copying.

### Open questions to settle while building

- Exact job-id extraction per site, with a fallback id (company plus title plus location) when a page carries none.
- Handling a description that has not finished loading when the user scrolls past quickly.
- A sensible per-session rank cap so a fast scroll does not fire dozens of calls at once.
- How to treat a posting that changed since it was ranked: re-rank on demand, or keep the first score.
- Cross-device dedup relies on the server's per-user rankings as the source of truth.

---

## 🔒 Principles

- **Honest over hopeful.** A correct "skip" beats an inflated match, and an estimate is labeled as an estimate.
- **Verified means verified.** Only the AI, after reading the full posting, can mark a job Strong.
- **Human in the loop.** We draft, you send. Always.
- **Cost-correct.** Free where possible, AI only where it earns its keep.
