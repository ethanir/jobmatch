## ✨ Overview

Most job tools do one of two things: **autofill** the same form a hundred times, or dump a feed of loosely-matched listings on you. Neither tells you *which roles are actually worth your time* or *who to talk to*. That's volume, not strategy.

**Jobrolu is different.** It runs the job search the way it actually works:

> **Aggregate** from the cleanest sources → **rank** every role honestly against *your* real profile → **hand you the recruiter** to email, with a personalized draft.

You stay in control of the final send. No spammy auto-apply, no getting your LinkedIn banned, no hallucinated matches. Just the best-fit roles and a clear next move for each.

## 📸 A look at it

**Landing** - dark, single-screen, built for software engineers.

![Landing page](docs/screenshots/01-landing.png)

**Onboarding** - build your profile two ways: upload a resume, or let your own AI describe you.

![Onboarding](docs/screenshots/02-onboarding.png)

**Bring your own AI** - copy a prompt into ChatGPT or Claude, paste the JSON back. Zero cost, no API key.

![Bring your own AI](docs/screenshots/03-bring-your-own-ai.png)

**The ranked feed** - every match is AI-verified on the full job description, with reasons, gaps, and a ready-to-send outreach email.

## 🚀 Live deployment

Jobrolu runs in production at **[www.jobrolu.com](https://www.jobrolu.com)**.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Host** | Railway (FastAPI server, deployed straight from this repo) |
| **Domain** | jobrolu.com via GoDaddy DNS, HTTPS auto-issued |
| **Access** | invite-only: a server-side access code gates the app, so only invited users can run anything that calls the AI |
| **Cost control** | per-IP rate limiting on the paid endpoint + an account-level spend cap, so the AI budget can't run away |
| **Secrets** | API keys live only in the host's private environment, never in this repo |

The landing page is public; the ranked feed and onboarding sit behind the access code.

## 🧠 How it works

```

         |
         v
  +----------------------------------------------+
  |  SOURCING   7 ATS + aggregator, self-growing   |
  |             company registry + curated lists  | --> ~40k live roles, parallel pull
  +----------------------------------------------+
         |
         v   free, rule-based
   PREFILTER  (title - seniority - location)        ~40k -> ~7k
         |
         v   free heuristic scorer (score.py), $0
   FUNNEL     skill overlap + title + location + recency, ranks ALL
         |
         v   fetch full posting for the TOP_N (hydrate.py), $0
   HYDRATE    so the AI sees the whole job page, not a snippet
         |
         v   LLM rubric - TOP_N only (default 100), the only paid step
   FIT-RANK   score - tier - reasons - gaps        ~$1 first run
         |
         v   cache (jobcache.py): only NEW jobs ever hit the LLM

## 🚀 Features

| | Feature | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 🔎 | **Multi-source sourcing** | Pulls live roles from **7 ATS platforms** (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Recruitee, Workable, Workday) plus the Adzuna keyword aggregator and curated new-grad lists. Pulls run in parallel - ~50k roles in a couple of minutes. |
| 🌱 | **Self-growing registry** | Every job URL teaches it a new company token, so coverage **compounds automatically** - no manual company list to maintain. |
| 📈 | **Registry seeding (`seed.py` / `bulk_seed.py`)** | Widen coverage on demand: validates candidate companies against their live ATS boards and adds only the ones that really return jobs. `bulk_seed.py` ships a large curated list (175+ known tech employers across Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby). **$0 API cost** (plain HTTP, no LLM), runs in parallel. This is the v2 "coverage" lever - more companies in the funnel, same ranking cost. |
| 💸 | **Cost-correct funnel** | A free heuristic scores *every* role; only the top N (default 100) hit the LLM. A full run costs **~$1, not ~$70.** Set `TOP_N=0` for a fully free run. |
| 🧠 | **Honest fit ranking** | The LLM scores your top matches with reasons and gaps. It will tell you to **skip** a bad fit. |
| ♻️ | **Seen-job cache** | Remembers what it already ranked, so **re-runs only pay for genuinely new jobs.** New postings are flagged **NEW** and float to the top. |
| ✍️ | **AI outreach drafts** | Every strong match gets a short, personalized email with its own **subject line**, led by your most relevant project, generated from your full profile. Subject and body each have their own one-click copy button. No em dashes (so it never reads as AI-written). You review and send from your own inbox. |
| 📇 | **Recruiter workflow** | One-click **"Find recruiter on LinkedIn"** for every strong match. Paste the recruiter's name back in and the email greeting + subject personalize instantly. (Apollo contact lookup is wired in but requires Apollo's paid API tier - the free LinkedIn flow is the default and costs nothing.) |
| 🖥️ | **Standalone viewer** | `make_ui.py` bakes the feed into a single `viewer.html` - no server, no build step. Filterable by Strong / Possible / Skip. Each role shows **Why you fit** (the positives) and **Worth knowing** (the honest concerns) split cleanly, plus matched skills and gaps. |
| 🔎 | **Scan any role** | Paste a JD or URL from LinkedIn / Handshake → instant fit-rank + draft for one role you found yourself. |
| 🧠 | **Smart free pre-filter** | A sharp heuristic scorer (exact-title, new-grad signal, SWE role family, seniority penalty, location, recency, skill saturation) ranks all ~50k jobs for **$0** and forwards only the genuinely-best to the LLM, so the paid step sees quality, not look-alikes. |
| ✅ | **"Strong" means AI-verified** | The free keyword pre-filter never awards "strong" - the best it can show is "possible". Only the LLM, after reading the full posting, can mark a job "strong". So every green "Strong fit" is one the AI actually analyzed, not a keyword coincidence. |
| 📄 | **Full-description hydration (`hydrate.py`)** | Before the AI ranks a job, the complete posting is fetched (Greenhouse, Lever, SmartRecruiters, Workday detail endpoints), so the AI sees everything on the page - including disqualifiers like "requires security clearance" or "5+ years". Runs only on the jobs about to be ranked, in parallel, $0. |
| 🎯 | **Whole-word skill matching + disqualifier signals** | The pre-filter matches skills as whole words (so "c" no longer matches "clearance") and down-weights security-clearance / high-experience roles a new grad can't satisfy. |
| 💸 | **Bring-your-own-AI ranking (`export_rank.py` / `import_rank.py`)** | Rank your top jobs for **$0 API** using the free web version of Claude or ChatGPT: export a ready-to-paste file, paste it into the web chat, paste the result back. The smart pre-filter shrinks the set first so a chat window can handle it. |
| 🛑 | **No auto-apply, no auto-send** | Deliberately. It protects your accounts, your sender reputation, and the quality of every application. |
| 🔄 | **Hosted live feed + refresh** | Run `server.py` and open the app in a browser: a single **Refresh jobs** button re-runs the whole pipeline in the background with a **live progress bar**. New postings are appended and flagged **NEW**; previously-found roles never disappear. This is the hosted version that v3 ships. |

## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethanir/jobmatch.git
cd jobmatch
pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# 1) build your profile from your resume (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
python3 onboard.py my_resume.pdf my_profile.json

# 2) rank (funnel + cache keep it cheap: ~$1 first run, near-free after)
export APOLLO_API_KEY=...               # optional: recruiter contacts
python3 main.py my_profile.json         # -> ranked_jobs.csv / ranked_jobs.json

# 3) view the feed (standalone, no server)
python3 make_ui.py                      # -> viewer.html
open viewer.html

# OR run the hosted live version: landing page, onboarding, live feed
uvicorn server:app --port 8000          # then open http://localhost:8000
```

> **Using the hosted site?** Open `http://localhost:8000`, click **Get started**, and
> build your profile by uploading a resume or pasting from your own AI. Then you're in
> the feed. If a PDF upload says it can't be read, your environment is just missing the
> PDF library: run `pip3 install --user pypdf python-docx` and try again (or upload a
> .txt / .docx, or use the bring-your-own-AI option, which needs no libraries at all).

**Free run** (no LLM cost at all): `TOP_N=0 python3 main.py my_profile.json`
**Rank more deeply** (costs more): `TOP_N=200 python3 main.py my_profile.json`
**Widen coverage** (add more companies, $0 API): `python3 bulk_seed.py` (or `seed.py`)
**Keep it fresh on a schedule:** `python3 worker.py --interval 60`

### Coverage, cost, and speed - how they relate
Three independent things, and only one of them costs money:

- **How many companies you pull from** (`seed.py` grows this). Pulling is plain HTTP and runs in parallel, so a bigger registry means **more jobs in the funnel at $0 extra API cost** and only a little more time (the pull is parallelized). This is the main quality lever.
- **The free heuristic scorer** rates *every* pulled job for $0. It picks which jobs the LLM sees.
- **How deep the LLM ranks** (`TOP_N`) is the **only** paid step, and its cost is fixed by `TOP_N` no matter how big the pool is:

| `TOP_N` | LLM ranks | Fresh-run cost | Re-run cost (cache) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 (default) | top 100 | ~$1 | ~$0 |
| 300 (good for a big pool) | top 300 | ~$2-3 | ~$0 |
| 0 + web-AI export | top ~30-40 via free web chat | **$0** | $0 |

For a large registry (e.g. 475 companies / ~50k jobs), `TOP_N=100` is too shallow, so your real matches can get crowded out; bump to `TOP_N=300`. Or go fully free: `TOP_N=0` then use `export_rank.py` + your own web AI. The smart scorer makes either work well because it forwards quality, not noise.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

**v1 - the engine (done).** Everything below works today, runs locally, and is the version that found and applied to real roles.

- [x] Multi-ATS sourcing across 6 platforms (parallel, ~40k roles in under a minute)
- [x] Self-growing company registry
- [x] Free prefilter + cost-correct LLM funnel (~$1 first run, near-free after)
- [x] Seen-job cache - re-runs only pay for genuinely new jobs
- [x] Honest fit ranking - Strong / Possible / Skip with reasons and gaps
- [x] Personalized AI outreach drafts per strong match (subject + body, em-dash-free)
- [x] Recruiter workflow - LinkedIn discovery + live name personalization
- [x] Standalone single-file viewer (Why-you-fit / Worth-knowing split, copy-ready email)
- [x] Scan-any-role (paste a JD/URL)

**v2 - the only thing left: coverage.** The ranking engine is strong; the one real ceiling is *how many jobs enter the funnel*. v1 scanned ~400 companies on 6 ATS types; v2 now covers 7 ATS platforms plus an aggregator. These three steps, in order of impact, take it from "a great slice" toward "scans everywhere," and are the entire remaining build:

1. **Expand the company registry** *(biggest win, least work)* - seed it from large public sources (YC company list, public Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby board directories, levels.fyi company list) to go from ~400 to several thousand companies. More companies in = more real roles ranked. `seed.py` / `bulk_seed.py` do this.
2. **Workday connector - ✅ done.** `from_workday` hits the public Workday CXS endpoint; seed employers with `seed_workday.py`. Opens up large-enterprise employers that were invisible before.
3. **Job-aggregator feed - ✅ done (Adzuna).** `from_adzuna` queries one keyword index across many boards, deduped against ATS pulls. Set `ADZUNA_APP_ID` / `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` to enable.

**v3 - launch.** Once coverage is wide, ship it as a real product:

4. **Name + domain: done.** Live at **jobrolu.com**.
5. **Buy the domain.**
6. **Build the landing page + hosted version** (accounts, the viewer served from the web instead of a local file).

> See **`ROADMAP.md`** for the full plan, name shortlist, and honest notes on scope, cost, and what's worth doing.

## 🔒 Principles

- **Honest over hopeful** - a correct "skip" beats an inflated match.
- **Human in the loop** - we draft; you send. Always.
- **Respect the inbox** - verified emails only, sane volume, your own sender identity.
- **Fresh or nothing** - a stale listing is a broken promise.
