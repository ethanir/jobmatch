## ✨ Overview

Most job tools do one of two things: **autofill** the same form a hundred times, or dump a feed of loosely-matched listings on you. Neither tells you *which roles are actually worth your time* or *who to talk to*. That's volume, not strategy.

**JobMatch is different.** It runs the job search the way it actually works:

> **Aggregate** from the cleanest sources → **rank** every role honestly against *your* real profile → **hand you the recruiter** to email, with a personalized draft.

You stay in control of the final send. No spammy auto-apply, no getting your LinkedIn banned, no hallucinated matches. Just the best-fit roles and a clear next move for each.

## 🚀 Features

| | Feature | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 🔎 | **Multi-source sourcing** | Pulls live roles from **6 ATS platforms** (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Recruitee, Workable) plus curated new-grad lists. Pulls run in parallel — ~40k roles in under a minute. |
| 🌱 | **Self-growing registry** | Every job URL teaches it a new company token, so coverage **compounds automatically** — no manual company list to maintain. |
| 📈 | **Registry seeding (`seed.py` / `bulk_seed.py`)** | Widen coverage on demand: validates candidate companies against their live ATS boards and adds only the ones that really return jobs. `bulk_seed.py` ships a large curated list (175+ known tech employers across Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby). **$0 API cost** (plain HTTP, no LLM), runs in parallel. This is the v2 "coverage" lever — more companies in the funnel, same ranking cost. |
| 💸 | **Cost-correct funnel** | A free heuristic scores *every* role; only the top N (default 100) hit the LLM. A full run costs **~$1, not ~$70.** Set `TOP_N=0` for a fully free run. |
| 🧠 | **Honest fit ranking** | The LLM scores your top matches with reasons and gaps. It will tell you to **skip** a bad fit. |
| ♻️ | **Seen-job cache** | Remembers what it already ranked, so **re-runs only pay for genuinely new jobs.** New postings are flagged **NEW** and float to the top. |
| ✍️ | **AI outreach drafts** | Every strong match gets a short, personalized email with its own **subject line**, led by your most relevant project, generated from your full profile. Subject and body each have their own one-click copy button. No em dashes (so it never reads as AI-written). You review and send from your own inbox. |
| 📇 | **Recruiter workflow** | One-click **"Find recruiter on LinkedIn"** for every strong match. Paste the recruiter's name back in and the email greeting + subject personalize instantly. (Apollo contact lookup is wired in but requires Apollo's paid API tier — the free LinkedIn flow is the default and costs nothing.) |
| 🖥️ | **Standalone viewer** | `make_ui.py` bakes the feed into a single `viewer.html` — no server, no build step. Filterable by Strong / Possible / Skip. Each role shows **Why you fit** (the positives) and **Worth knowing** (the honest concerns) split cleanly, plus matched skills and gaps. |
| 🔎 | **Scan any role** | Paste a JD or URL from LinkedIn / Handshake → instant fit-rank + draft for one role you found yourself. |
| 🧠 | **Smart free pre-filter** | A sharp heuristic scorer (exact-title, new-grad signal, SWE role family, seniority penalty, location, recency, skill saturation) ranks all ~50k jobs for **$0** and forwards only the genuinely-best to the LLM, so the paid step sees quality, not look-alikes. |
| 💸 | **Bring-your-own-AI ranking (`export_rank.py` / `import_rank.py`)** | Rank your top jobs for **$0 API** using the free web version of Claude or ChatGPT: export a ready-to-paste file, paste it into the web chat, paste the result back. The smart pre-filter shrinks the set first so a chat window can handle it. |
| 🛑 | **No auto-apply, no auto-send** | Deliberately. It protects your accounts, your sender reputation, and the quality of every application. |
| 🔄 | **Hosted live feed + refresh** | Run `server.py` and open the app in a browser: a single **Refresh jobs** button re-runs the whole pipeline in the background with a **live progress bar**. New postings are appended and flagged **NEW**; previously-found roles never disappear. This is the hosted version that v3 ships. |

## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethanir/jobmatch.git
cd jobmatch
pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# 1) build your profile from your resume (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
python3 onboard.py my_resume.pdf my_profile.json

# 2) rank (funnel + cache keep it cheap: ~$1 first run, near-free after)
export APOLLO_API_KEY=...               # optional: recruiter contacts
python3 main.py my_profile.json         # -> ranked_jobs.csv / ranked_jobs.json

# 3) view the feed (standalone, no server)
python3 make_ui.py                      # -> viewer.html
open viewer.html

# OR run the hosted live version with a refresh button + progress bar
uvicorn server:app --port 8000          # then open http://localhost:8000
```

**Free run** (no LLM cost at all): `TOP_N=0 python3 main.py my_profile.json`
**Rank more deeply** (costs more): `TOP_N=200 python3 main.py my_profile.json`
**Widen coverage** (add more companies, $0 API): `python3 bulk_seed.py` (or `seed.py`)
**Keep it fresh on a schedule:** `python3 worker.py --interval 60`

### Coverage, cost, and speed — how they relate
Three independent things, and only one of them costs money:

- **How many companies you pull from** (`seed.py` grows this). Pulling is plain HTTP and runs in parallel, so a bigger registry means **more jobs in the funnel at $0 extra API cost** and only a little more time (the pull is parallelized). This is the main quality lever.
- **The free heuristic scorer** rates *every* pulled job for $0. It picks which jobs the LLM sees.
- **How deep the LLM ranks** (`TOP_N`) is the **only** paid step, and its cost is fixed by `TOP_N` no matter how big the pool is:

| `TOP_N` | LLM ranks | Fresh-run cost | Re-run cost (cache) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 (default) | top 100 | ~$1 | ~$0 |
| 300 (good for a big pool) | top 300 | ~$2-3 | ~$0 |
| 0 + web-AI export | top ~30-40 via free web chat | **$0** | $0 |

For a large registry (e.g. 475 companies / ~50k jobs), `TOP_N=100` is too shallow — your real matches can get crowded out, so bump to `TOP_N=300`. Or go fully free: `TOP_N=0` then use `export_rank.py` + your own web AI. The smart scorer makes either work well because it forwards quality, not noise.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

**v1 — the engine (done).** Everything below works today, runs locally, and is the version that found and applied to real roles.

- [x] Multi-ATS sourcing across 6 platforms (parallel, ~40k roles in under a minute)
- [x] Self-growing company registry
- [x] Free prefilter + cost-correct LLM funnel (~$1 first run, near-free after)
- [x] Seen-job cache — re-runs only pay for genuinely new jobs
- [x] Honest fit ranking — Strong / Possible / Skip with reasons and gaps
- [x] Personalized AI outreach drafts per strong match (subject + body, em-dash-free)
- [x] Recruiter workflow — LinkedIn discovery + live name personalization
- [x] Standalone single-file viewer (Why-you-fit / Worth-knowing split, copy-ready email)
- [x] Scan-any-role (paste a JD/URL)

**v2 — the only thing left: coverage.** The ranking engine is strong; the one real ceiling is *how many jobs enter the funnel*. v1 scans ~400 companies on 6 ATS types. These three steps, in order of impact, take it from "a great slice" toward "scans everywhere," and are the entire remaining build:

1. **Expand the company registry** *(biggest win, least work)* — seed it from large public sources (YC company list, public Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby board directories, levels.fyi company list) to go from ~400 to several thousand companies. More companies in = more real roles ranked.
2. **Add a Workday connector** — the single biggest missing ATS. A large share of mid-to-large employers post only on Workday, so it's currently invisible to the tool. Harder than the JSON-clean ATS APIs, but the largest coverage gap.
3. **Pull from a job-aggregator feed** — invert the problem from "list every company" to "query one giant index," then dedupe against the ATS pulls. This is the path to true "everything, everywhere" coverage.

**v3 — launch.** Once coverage is wide, ship it as a real product:

4. **Pick a final name** (`JobMatch` is taken — see `ROADMAP.md` for the shortlist).
5. **Buy the domain.**
6. **Build the landing page + hosted version** (accounts, the viewer served from the web instead of a local file).

> See **`ROADMAP.md`** for the full plan, name shortlist, and honest notes on scope, cost, and what's worth doing.

## 🔒 Principles

- **Honest over hopeful** — a correct "skip" beats an inflated match.
- **Human in the loop** — we draft; you send. Always.
- **Respect the inbox** — verified emails only, sane volume, your own sender identity.
- **Fresh or nothing** — a stale listing is a broken promise.
