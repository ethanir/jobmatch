## ✨ What it is

Most job tools either autofill the same form a hundred times, or dump a feed of loosely-matched listings on you. Neither tells you which roles are actually worth your time, or who to talk to.

**Who it's for:** engineers at every seniority, from new grad to staff, across software, infrastructure, data, ML, and security. The shared pool is broad and each person's feed is narrowed to their own discipline, level, and location, so one account fits a backend new grad and a senior SRE alike.

Jobrolu runs the search the way it actually works: **aggregate** from clean sources, **rank** every role honestly against a real profile, and **hand you the recruiter** to email with a personalized draft. You always do the final send. No spammy auto-apply, no hallucinated matches.

**You make an account first.** Jobrolu ranks against *you*, so you sign up, build a profile (a quick form, a resume, or your own AI), and a feed of the live job pool ranked for you unlocks. Everyone has an equal account; each person gets their own profile and their own ranked feed.

---

## 🧠 How it works (the funnel)

The whole design exists to keep cost near zero while still using AI where it matters. Jobs flow through stages, and **only one stage costs money**.

## 🏷️ How ranking works, and what the scores mean

**This is the most important thing to understand, because two different systems produce the numbers you see.**

There are two scorers, and they are NOT on the same scale:

1. **The free heuristic scorer** (`score.py`) reads keywords, the job title, seniority words, and location. It is fast and free, and it runs on *every* job. It is a rough guess. It can give a high number to a job just because the title looks right ("Graduate Software Engineer" scores high on the new-grad and SWE-title signals even if zero of your skills appear in the text).

2. **The AI fit-ranker** (`rank.py`) reads the *full job description* against your profile and produces a careful, considered score with real reasons, gaps, and disqualifiers. Only the top N jobs (default 100) ever reach this step, because it is the only paid step.

### The three tiers

| Tier | Who decided it | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **Strong** | The AI only | The AI read the full posting and confirmed a strong fit. Trustworthy. The heuristic can **never** award Strong. |
| 🟡 **Possible** | AI *or* heuristic | Either the AI judged it a moderate fit, or it only passed the free keyword pre-filter and the AI has not read it yet. |
| ⚪ **Skip** | AI *or* heuristic | Clear non-fit (seniority, clearance, wrong role), or a low heuristic score. |

### Why a "Possible" can show a higher number than a "Strong" (and why that is correct)

You will sometimes see a Possible job at, say, **78** sitting above a Strong job at **72**. That is expected, not a bug:

- The **78** is the *free heuristic's* unverified estimate. The AI never read that job.
- The **72** is the *AI's* verified verdict after reading the full posting.

A verified 72 is worth more than an unverified 78. They measure different things. To make this obvious, the UI marks the difference:

- **AI-verified** scores show in solid color with an **"AI verified"** tag and a `FIT` ring.
- **Estimated** (heuristic, not yet read by the AI) scores show muted, prefixed with a `~`, with an **"Estimate only"** tag and an `EST` ring.

So a green `88` with "AI verified" is a real judgment. A grey `~78` with "Estimate only" is a hunch to be confirmed.

### Turning estimates into verified scores

The free pass ranks the whole pool, but only your top matches are AI-read, and a genuinely good role with a plain or unusual title can sit lower until an AI reads it. Two ways to verify:

- **Bring-your-own-AI, right in the app (free).** On your feed, **Rank my matches** hands you a ready-made prompt covering your top 150 roles, each with its full description, to paste into your own ChatGPT or Claude. Paste the JSON back and those roles become verified fits, stored as yours, for **$0**. (The `export_rank.py` / `import_rank.py` CLI does the same from the command line.)
- **`TOP_N`** for a paid command-line run that reads deeper into the pool (see the cost model below).

---

## 💸 Cost model

Only the AI fit-rank step costs money. Everything else (sourcing, prefilter, heuristic scoring, hydration, the LinkedIn recruiter search) is plain HTTP and free.

| Scan depth | Jobs the AI reads | First run | Re-run (cache) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 (default) | top 100 | ~$1 | ~$0 |
| 300 | top 300 | ~$2-3 | ~$0 |
| 800 (deep sweep) | top 800 | ~$8 | ~$0 |
| Rank my matches | top 150, your own AI | **$0** | $0 |

In the app, the free **Rank my matches** flow (your own AI, top 150) costs **$0** and is the default way to verify. Paid depths above are set with `TOP_N` on the host for deeper command-line sweeps. The **cache** makes repeats free: a job already AI-read is never paid for again, so a re-run only pays for genuinely new jobs. The server hard-caps any single run at 2000 jobs as a backstop, and an Anthropic spend cap is the final ceiling.

The **cache** (`jobcache.py`) is what keeps it cheap: each posting has a stable id, and once the AI ranks it, the result is reused forever. Re-runs only pay for jobs that are genuinely new since last time.

Resume parsing on profile upload is one small LLM call (cents). It reads even scanned/image-only PDFs, and infers your likely target roles and location from your experience, which you review and edit before saving. Outreach drafts for strong matches are cents and are also cached.

---

## 🔐 Accounts and budget protection

Everyone has an equal account; there is no special owner tier. The model is simple:

- **Create an account, then build a profile.** Sign up with an email and password, then build your profile (a quick form, a resume upload, or letting your own AI describe you). The feed is gated: you must be signed in, and you need a profile, so nobody lands on a wall of unranked jobs or sees someone else's scores.
- **Sign in and sign out.** Passwords are hashed (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, stdlib, no extra dependency) with a per-user salt and verified in constant time; the session is a signed, HttpOnly cookie. A profile built before signing up is kept, but a second account created on the same browser gets its own identity, so accounts never overwrite each other and one account never sees another's profile.
- **Your feed is yours.** Once you have a profile, you see the shared job pool ranked for *you* by the free heuristic, plus any roles you have personally verified. New jobs show as estimates until you verify them.
- **Verifying is free for everyone.** **Rank my matches** turns your top 150 roles into verified fits using your own ChatGPT or Claude, at no cost; it sends each role's full description so the AI judges the complete posting. Those verified rankings are stored against your profile and overlay your feed. Resume upload is open to every signed-in account.
- **The job pool refreshes itself.** New roles are pulled and heuristic-ranked automatically on a schedule (free, no AI), so the feed stays current on its own; the app shows a live countdown to the next scan. Any action that spends the deployment's API budget stays behind the access code, and a spend cap in the Anthropic console is the hard ceiling.
- **The shared pool is durable.** Each Refresh writes the resulting pool to Postgres, not just the host's disk, so a redeploy never reverts it. The feed reads the pool from Postgres (falling back to the committed file when the database is empty or off) and caches it in memory, so it is not re-parsed on every request.

Configure on the host (Railway) with env vars:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Required, powers ranking and drafts |
| `ACCESS_CODE` | The code that gates any action which spends the API budget (a paid refresh or single-role scan). Those actions are open to anyone if unset |
| `COOKIE_SECRET` | Fixed random string so sessions and the refresh unlock survive redeploys |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres for accounts, per-user profiles, per-user rankings, and the durable shared job pool (with no database set, the site serves the committed file feed and skips accounts, for local dev) |
| `DB_POOL_MAX` | Optional. Max pooled DB connections (default 10) |
| `SCAN_INTERVAL_HOURS` | Optional. Hours between automatic free job pulls (default 24) |
| `AUTO_SCAN` | Optional. Set to `0` to disable the automatic scheduled pull (default on) |
| `PROFILE_PATH` | Optional. The owner profile file the command-line pipeline reads (default `my_profile.json`) |
| `ENRICH_DESCRIPTIONS` | Optional. Set to `1` to fetch full descriptions for boards that omit them (SmartRecruiters, Workday) before ranking |
| `OWNER_USER_ID` | Optional. A fixed random id that marks the owner across devices |

API keys live only in the host's private environment, never in this repo.

## 📡 Sources and coverage

Live roles are pulled in parallel from **7 ATS platforms** (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Recruitee, Workable, Workday) plus the **Adzuna** keyword aggregator and curated new-grad lists.

The **self-growing registry** (`registry.py`) reads the ATS token out of every job URL it ingests, so the company list compounds automatically. Widen coverage on demand with `seed.py`, `bulk_seed.py`, or `seed_workday.py` (all $0 API, validated against live boards).

A few boards (SmartRecruiters, Workday) leave the description out of their list feed. `enrich_desc.py` can fetch the full posting from their detail pages for the roles about to be ranked, so the AI reads the complete text on those too (enable with `ENRICH_DESCRIPTIONS=1`).

Out of scope by design: LinkedIn and Indeed forbid scraping. The right way to use those is applying directly, by hand.

## 🧭 Future task: capture jobs from anywhere (designed, prototyped, parked)

This is a planned addition, **not yet live**. It was fully designed and a working browser-extension prototype was built, then parked to keep the live site lean. The prototype code is preserved privately in the `jobrolu-extension.zip` download (kept closed source, not in this public repo). Everything below is the spec to resume from.

**The vision.** Let a user fill their feed from anywhere: paste a job they found, and, with a browser extension, have jobs they open on LinkedIn or Handshake scored against their Jobrolu profile and added to their feed automatically. Every account links its own extension, so each person's browsing fills their own feed. Handshake first (friendlier), then LinkedIn.

### Phase 0: paste a job to feed
A per-user store of saved jobs that the paste flow uses and the extension reuses.
- Table `saved_jobs` (user_id, job_id, company, title, location, description, url, source, date_posted, created_at; primary key user_id + job_id). Functions get/save/delete; save UPSERTs keyed by job id or job hash and preserves the fuller description or url on a re-add; delete also clears any ranking attached to the job.
- `POST /api/saved/add` (session-authed): parse the pasted text, cheaply guess title/company/location, store it, heuristic-score it, return the card. `POST /api/saved/remove` ({id}) deletes it.
- The feed merges saved jobs in, exempts them from the tier filter (a saved job always shows), and lists unranked saved jobs first when building the free ranking prompt, so a pasted job is scored by the same brain as everything else and rides the free bring-your-own-AI ranking at no cost.
- UI: an "Add a job" button and a small modal (paste the description plus optional title/company/location/link) on the feed.

### Phase 1: the server contract for the extension
The extension runs on linkedin.com and handshake, so it cannot use the site cookie. It authenticates with a per-user token.
- Table `ext_tokens` (token_hash, user_id, created_at, last_used_at). Only a SHA-256 hash is stored; the raw token is shown once and rotates on every generate, so reconnecting replaces the old key. Functions: create (rotate), resolve-to-user (stamps last_used), has-token, revoke.
- `POST /api/ext/token` (session-authed): issue or rotate and return the raw token once. `POST /api/ext/disconnect`: revoke. `GET /api/ext/status`: connected or not.
- `POST /api/ext/ingest` (token-authed): store the viewed job, dedup it, heuristic-score it, and for a job with no verified ranking yet return a one-job AI prompt built from the FULL profile. The cost guarantee lives here: once a job has a verified ranking, ingest returns that cached score and NO prompt, so the user's AI is never spent on the same posting twice no matter how often they refresh or revisit.
- `POST /api/ext/rank` (token-authed, idempotent): store the verified ranking the user's own AI returned, marked `ai_ext`, which then overlays the feed like any other ranking.
- This was covered by 22 server tests (token issuance and the sign-in requirement, ingest dedup and the no-re-charge contract, the full-profile prompt, rank storage, feed overlay, disconnect). Phase 0 had 19.

### The extension (Manifest V3)
- `config.js` shared constants; `sites.js` the only file that knows LinkedIn/Handshake page structure (ordered selector lists per field with generic fallbacks, relative-date parsing, and the apply-link rule); `content.js` the on-page engine; `background.js` the service worker; `popup.html/css/js` the settings UI; icons; and an INSTALL.md.
- Flow: detect when a job is open (these are single-page apps, so the URL changes without a reload, handled with a history patch, popstate, a URL poll, and a mutation observer, all debounced), expand the "see more" description and wait, read the fields, and send the job to the background worker. The worker checks a local cache so a verified job is never re-ranked, calls ingest, shows the instant estimate, and if the user supplied their own AI key runs the returned prompt in their OWN AI (Anthropic or OpenAI) and posts the verified ranking back. The user's AI does the paid work, so this costs Jobrolu nothing.
- Feedback: a small pill on the page goes Scanning, then Estimate, then the verified score with a soft sound and a flash when it syncs; the toolbar badge mirrors the score; desktop notifications are optional. Without an AI key the user still gets estimates and jobs still land in the feed, to verify later on the site.

### Decisions captured
- Include both Easy Apply and external roles; both are scored the same. The apply link stored differs: the external URL when the apply button redirects to the company site, otherwise the LinkedIn or Handshake page URL. In practice LinkedIn rarely exposes the external URL in the page (it resolves on click), so most LinkedIn external jobs fall back to the page link, which still reaches the posting; Handshake exposes external links more often.
- Read the full description, including the text behind "see more", because the full text scores far better than a snippet. This is also why the extension beats a server fetch: LinkedIn and Handshake sit behind login and JavaScript, so a server request only hits a wall while the user's own logged-in page already has the full text.
- Capture the posted date shown on the page (parse relative text like "2 weeks ago") so recency feeds the score and the card.
- Send the user's full profile (experience, projects, skills) into the AI prompt, and build the prompt server-side so the extension never holds the profile and the context is always complete.
- Keep it free with the user's own AI key (bring-your-own-AI), and keep the extension closed source.

### The one non-deterministic part
Everything except page-reading is deterministic. The LinkedIn and Handshake selectors are best-effort with layered fallbacks and a debug mode, but those sites change their HTML, so resuming this needs one in-browser verification pass: set `debug: true` in config.js, open a job, read the `[Jobrolu] extracted` console line, and fix the selector at the front of the relevant list in sites.js. Handshake's React-hashed class names lean on the fallbacks most.

### Open questions for later
- When a posting changes after it was ranked, whether and when to re-rank (today the first score is kept).
- Extracting the true external apply URL on LinkedIn more reliably.
- LinkedIn's terms of service: reading pages, even read-only, is against them; the extension stays read-only and user-paced, which is lower risk than server scraping, but it is the user's account.

## 🔒 Principles

- **Honest over hopeful.** A correct "skip" beats an inflated match, and an estimate is labeled as an estimate.
- **Verified means verified.** Only the AI, after reading the full posting, can mark a job Strong.
- **Human in the loop.** We draft, you send. Always.
- **Cost-correct.** Free where possible, AI only where it earns its keep.
