"""
Free heuristic scorer - ranks every job for the user with ZERO API cost.

This is the matching core. It scores the whole pool against the user's profile so
the best-fitting roles rise to the top, and only the top slice ever needs a paid
LLM read. It is deliberately transparent: every point a job earns or loses maps to
a concrete, readable reason, so the user can see exactly why a role ranked where it
did.

Design choices that make the match actually good:
  * Profile-derived, not persona-hardcoded. The desired seniority and the role
    family come from the user's own resume/targets, so it works for a new grad, a
    senior engineer, or an adjacent role equally. It does NOT assume "new grad SWE".
  * Title fit is the dominant signal. What a role IS matters more than which stray
    keywords it happens to contain, so a real title/role match outweighs a pile of
    coincidental skill hits.
  * Honest about thin postings. Some job boards (e.g. SmartRecruiters, Workday) omit
    the description in their public feed, so a missing description is not proof the
    job is bad. We mildly down-weight a role we can't fully read and flag it ("open
    the posting to confirm") rather than burying it.
  * 'strong' is never awarded here. Keyword reading can't see real disqualifiers, so
    the best a free score shows is 'possible'; only an LLM that reads the full
    posting earns 'strong'. That keeps every green "Strong fit" meaningful.
