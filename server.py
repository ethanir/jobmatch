"""
FastAPI server - serves the ranked feed to the UI.

Access model (simple and wallet-safe):
    - Viewing the feed is OPEN to everyone (landing, /app, /api/jobs).
    - Anything that spends the API budget or changes data is OWNER-ONLY, gated
      behind a single access code: refresh, scan, onboard, save-profile.
    - Unlock once with the code and a cookie keeps you unlocked. The feed itself
      never asks for a code.

Set ACCESS_CODE in the host's env (e.g. ACCESS_CODE=ethan) to turn the gate on.
If ACCESS_CODE is unset, the gate is OFF (handy for local dev).
Optionally set COOKIE_SECRET to a fixed random string so the unlock survives
redeploys (otherwise it resets each restart and you re-enter the code once).

Identity (Phase 2):
    Every visitor gets a stable per-browser id in an httponly cookie (jr_uid),
    resolved on every request as request.state.user_id and best-effort upserted
    into the users table. This is the foundation for per-user profiles and
    rankings. It is invisible today: the feed still serves the shared file feed
    for everyone, because no one has per-user rankings yet. See the browser
    identity section below.

Data source resolution:
    1. If DATABASE_URL is set and reachable -> Postgres (db.py).
    2. Otherwise -> read ranked_jobs.json produced by main.py (dev fallback).

Run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000
