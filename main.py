"""
Orchestrator - the FUNNEL version (cost-correct).

  profile -> pull jobs -> discover companies -> prefilter (free)
          -> heuristic score ALL (free) -> LLM-rank only NEW top-N (cheap)
          -> reuse cached rankings for everything already scanned (free)
          -> heuristic-tier the rest (free) -> ranked feed

Cost: a full run is ~$1 instead of ~$70, because we only pay the LLM for the
top TOP_N most promising jobs. The cache then makes every later run nearly free,
because a job we already paid to rank is never re-ranked. Set TOP_N=0 for a
totally free run (no LLM).

Run:
    python main.py my_profile.json
    TOP_N=0  python main.py my_profile.json     # free, no API cost
    TOP_N=200 python main.py my_profile.json     # rank more (costs more)
